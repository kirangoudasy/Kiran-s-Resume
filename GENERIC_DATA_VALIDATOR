SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) is a framework provided by SAP, used for developing enterprise-grade cloud applications on SAP BTP. It allows you to create REST/OData APIs with minimal configurations. A few benefits of using CAP for your REST APIs include:
• No requirement for complex boilerplate code, as services and data models are defined using CDS files.
• Built-in service runtime that exposes REST and OData endpoints automatically without manual API configuration.
• Integrated database handling with SAP HANA, where CAP manages queries, transactions, and connections internally.
• Automatic handling of dependency injection and lifecycle management for services, eliminating the need for manual object creation.
• Support for custom business logic using event handlers, making it easy to implement validations, file processing, and data checks.
This makes CAP suitable for building scalable and maintainable backend services in cloud-based enterprise applications.
