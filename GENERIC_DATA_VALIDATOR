5.1	Spring Rest API:

Spring Boot is a Java framework, built on top of the Spring framework, used for developing web applications. It allows you to create REST APIs with minimal configurations. A few benefits of using Spring Boot for your REST APIs include:

•	No requirement for complex XML configurations.
•	Embedded Tomcat server to run Spring Boot applications.
•	An auto-configuration feature by Spring Boot that configures your application automatically for certain dependencies. If the dependency is available in your class path, Spring Boot will auto-create the beans for it. Beans in Spring are objects that are instantiated and managed by Spring through Spring IoC containers. You don't have to create and configure the beans as Spring Boot will do it for you.
