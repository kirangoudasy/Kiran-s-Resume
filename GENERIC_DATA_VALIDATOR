--> Using Projection Nodes
1. The Projection node is one of the most popular node types.Projection nodes usually appear in most calculation views of all types. They provide many useful
features that most calculation views require.
2. A Projection node is typically used to achieve the following:
* To select only the required columns from a data source.
* To define calculated columns.
* To define parameters that request values at run-time, such as user-prompts.
* To apply a filter on the data source.

--> Working with Aggregation Nodes
1. The purpose of an Aggregation node is to apply aggregate functions to measures based on one or several attributes. The node generates a result set that is
grouped by the selected attribute columns and computes the selected measure with the specified function, such as SUM, MIN, AVG, and so on.
